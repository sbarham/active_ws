CURRENTLY THE SYSTEM IS STUBBED

To run, active all nodes in separate terminals and then input a word to
the language input node.  This should run through all nodes in order of:

language --> alma
alma --> vision
vision --> alma
alma --> simulator
simlator --> alma
alma --> action
action --> alma
alma --> language

Then the program waits and will repeat again on another language input node
entry.
